In this paper we report about the Urban Systems Framework (USF) that was developed within the Digital Phoenix project at Arizona State University. Digital Phoenix is an effort to create a planning tool that allows keen insight into urban dynamics in the Phoenix metropolitan area through the use of state-of-art visualization, simulation, and GIS tools, combined with detailed social, economic and environmental data. These goals are only achievable in a collaborative interdisciplinary research approach. This approach led to several technological challenges during the course of the research:

# Storage and organization of the data that researchers and collaborators need for their work
# Automation of data processing, conversion, and automated execution of simulations
# Interoperability for collaboration and distribution of result sets

The framework that we present in this paper addresses these challenges. It is built on a data centric workflow, allows the use of many freely available software tools due to the use of open standards, and supports collaboration with internet based infrastructure.
