h1. NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT COMPLETE

Software design in general is a very subjective process. This means the design produced is highly dependent on the skill and knowledge of the designer. Evaluating such designs is problematic. A prescriptive design method would allow all designers to produce a similar design that is not dependent on their knowledge of the problem domain, but of the design domain. Here I look at two papers that presented methodologies to produce such a design.
